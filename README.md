# passwordGenerator
A Password Generator for you to use. I highly recommend editing it to your liking. If you would like to, add more words to the wordOption list at the very beginning, as well as the numberOptions list. Enjoy!

To test the password you generated, I used:

# Libraries
Don't forget to install the required libraries, I used pip.

> pip install tk 
> pip install pillow
